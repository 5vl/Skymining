# Skymining

This is a project that I'm actually proud of. It's entirely made in Kotlin, and isn't very messy.
It's a core plugin for a Skymining server. Some features:
- Configurable mines
- Autocompressors
- Teleport scrolls
- Compressed items
- Autoreset for the mines
- Reset command for the mines
- A command blocker

There are some slight bugs that I know about, but I haven't gotten around to fixing them yet.
